**FeltPowered**, as an organization, is a group comprised of several people with the goal of providing a more "universal" way of modifying C# applications. This **does not** include Unity, or any programs with similar usages of C# assemblies. The tools written may contextually apply, though.

## Projects
The main functionality of _Felt_ is split into three projects.

### `felt`[https://github.com/feltpowered/felt]
The backbone of the _FeltPowered_ project, a program bootstrapper/mod loader for C# applications. 

### `needle`[https://github.com/feltpowered/needle]
A plugin framework and API for Mono.Cecil, allowing easy and quick assembly transformation. 

### `fiber`[https://github.com/feltpowered/fiber]
A simple modding framework which handles assembly management and resolution, and provides an API for interacton and loading.
